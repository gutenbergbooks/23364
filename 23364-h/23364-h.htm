    </p>
    <p>
      She had never felt so tired of it all, it seemed to her. The sun streamed
      hot across the backs of the shining seats into her eyes, but she was too
      tired to get the window-pole. She watched the incoming class listlessly,
      wondering whether it would be worth while to ask one of them to close the
      shutter. They chattered and giggled and bustled in, rattling the chairs
      about, and begging one another's pardon vociferously, with that insistent
      politeness which marks a sharply defined stage in the social evolution of
      the young girl. They irritated her excessively&mdash;these little airs and
      graces. She opened her book with a snap, and began to call the roll
      sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Midway up the room sat a tall, dark girl, not handsome, but noticeably
      well dressed. She looked politely at her questioner when spoken to, but
      seemed as far in spirit as the distant trees toward which she directed her
      attention when not particularly addressed. She seemed to have a certain
      personality, a self-possession, a source of interest other than
      collegiate; and this held her apart from the others in the mind of the
      woman who sat before the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was that girl thinking of, she wondered, as she called another name
      and glanced at the book to gather material for a question. What a perfect
      taste had combined that dark, brocaded vest with the dull, rough cloth of
      the suit&mdash;and she dressed her hair so well! She had a beautiful band
      of pearls on one finger: was it an engagement-ring? No, that would be a
      solitaire.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all this time she called names from the interminable list, and
      mechanically corrected the mistakes of their owners. Her eyes went back to
      the girl in the middle row, who turned her head and yawned a little. They
      took their education very easily, these maidens.
    </p>
    <p>
      How she had saved and denied herself, and even consented to the
      indebtedness she so hated, to gain that coveted German winter! And how
      delightful it had been!
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost she saw again the dear home of that blessed year: the kindly
      housemother; the chubby <i>Mädchen</i> who knitted her a silk purse, and
      cried when she left; the father with his beloved 'cello and his deep,
      honest voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      How cunning the little Bertha had been! How pleasant it was to hear her
      gay little voice when one came down the shady street!&rdquo;<i>Da ist sie, ja!</i>&rdquo;
       she would call to her mother, and then Hermann would come up to her with
      his hands outstretched. Had she had a hard day? Was the lecture good? How
      brown his beard was, and how deep and faithful his brown eyes were! And he
      used to sing&mdash;why were there no bass voices in the States?&ldquo;<i>Kennst
      du das Land</i>&rdquo; he used to sing, and his mother cried softly to herself
      for pleasure. And once she herself had cried a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said to the girl who was reciting, &ldquo;no, it takes the dative. I
      cannot seem to impress sufficiently on your minds the necessity for
      learning that list thoroughly. You may translate now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And they translated. How they drawled it over, the beautiful, rich German.
      Hermann had begged so, but she had felt differently then. She had loved
      her work in anticipation. To marry and settle down&mdash;she was not
      ready. It would be so good to be independent. And now&mdash;But it was too
      late. That was years ago. Hermann must have found some yellow-braided,
      blue-eyed Dorothea by this&mdash;some <i>Mädchen</i> who cared not for
      calculus and Hebrew, but only to be what her mother had been, wife and
      house-mother. But this was treason. Our grandmothers had thought that.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at the girl in the middle row. What beautiful hair she had!
      What an idiot she was to give up four years of her life to this round of
      work and play and pretence of living! Oh, to go back to Germany&mdash;to
      see Bertha and her mother again, and hear the father's 'cello! Hermann had
      loved her so! He had said, so quietly and yet so surely: &ldquo;But thou wilt
      come back, my heart's own. And always I wait here for thee. Make me not
      wait long!&rdquo; He had seemed too quiet then&mdash;too slow and too easily
      content. She had wanted quicker, busier, more individual life. And now her
      heart said, &ldquo;O fool!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Was it too late? Suppose she should go, after all? Suppose she should go,
      and all should be as it had been, only a little older, a little more quiet
      and peaceful? The very fancy filled her heart with sudden calm. A love so
      deep and sure, so broad and sweet&mdash;could it not dignify any woman's
      life? And she had been thought worthy and had refused this love! O fool!
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose she went and found&mdash;her heart beat too quickly, and her face
      flushed. She called on the bright girl in the front row.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what have <i>you</i> learned?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl coughed importantly. &ldquo;It is a poem of Goethe's,&rdquo; she announced in
      her high, satisfied voice. &ldquo;<i>Kennst du das Land</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; said the German assistant. &ldquo;I fear we shall not have time
      for it to-day. The hour is up. You may go on with the translation for
      to-morrow.&rdquo; And as the class rose with a growing clamor she realized that
      though she had been thinking steadily in German, she had been talking in
      English. So that was why they had comprehended so well and answered so
      readily! And yet she was too glad to be annoyed at the slip. There were
      other things: her life was not a German class!
    </p>
    <p>
      As the girls crowded out, one stopped by the desk. She laid her hand with
      the pearl band on the third finger on the teacher's arm. &ldquo;You look tired,&rdquo;
       she said. &ldquo;I hope you're not ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ill?&rdquo; said the woman at the desk. &ldquo;I never felt better. I've been
      neglecting my classes, I fear, in the study of your green gown. It is so
      very pretty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl smiled and colored a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad you like it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I like it, too.&rdquo; Then, with a sudden
      feeling of friendship, an odd sense of intimacy, a quick impulse of common
      femininity, she added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've had some good times in this dress. Wearing it up here makes me
      remember them very strangely. It's queer, what a difference it makes&mdash;&rdquo;
       She stopped and looked questioningly at the older woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the German assistant smiled at her. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it is. And when
      you have been teaching seven years the difference becomes very apparent.&rdquo;
       She gathered up her books, still smiling in a reminiscent way. And as she
      went out of the door, she looked back at the glaring, sunny room as if
      already it were far behind her, as if already she felt the house-mother's
      kiss, and heard the 'cello, and saw Klara's tiny daughter standing by the
      door, throwing kisses, calling, &ldquo;<i>Da ist sie, ja!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lost in the dream, her eyes fixed absently, she stumbled against her
      fellow-assistant, who was making for the room she had just left.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon&mdash;I wasn't looking. Oh, it's you!&rdquo; she murmured
      vaguely. Her fellow-assistant had a headache, and forty-five written
      papers to correct. She had just heard, too, a cutting criticism of her
      work made by the self-appointed faculty critic; the criticism was cleverly
      worded, and had just enough truth to fly quickly and hurt her with the
      head of her department. So she was not in the best of tempers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it's I,&rdquo; she said crossly. &ldquo;If you had knocked these papers an inch
      farther, I should have invited you to correct them. If you go about in
      that abstracted way much longer, my dear, Miss Selbourne will inform the
      world (on the very best authority) that you're in love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? What nonsense!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a ridiculous thing to say, and she flushed angrily at herself. It
      was only a joke, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other woman laughed shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me! I really believe you are!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;The girls were saying
      at breakfast that Professor Tredick was ruining himself in violets
      yesterday&mdash;so it was for you!&rdquo; and she went into the lecture-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      A chattering crowd of girls closed in behind her. One voice rose above the
      rest:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't know what you call it, then. He skated with her all the
      winter, and at the Dickinson party they sat on one sofa for an hour and
      talked steadily!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nonsense! She skates beautifully, that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She sits on a sofa beautifully, too.&rdquo; A burst of laughter, and the door
      closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The German assistant smiled satirically. It was all of a piece. At least,
      the younger women were perfectly frank about it: they did not feel
      themselves forced to employ sarcasm in their references; it was not
      necessary for them to appear to have definitely chosen this life in
      preference to any other. Four years was little to lend to such an
      experiment. But the older women, who sat on those prim little platforms
      year after year&mdash;a sudden curiosity possessed her to know how many of
      them were really satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Could it be that they had preferred&mdash;actually preferred&mdash;But she
      had, herself, three years ago. She shook her head decidedly. &ldquo;Not for nine
      years, not for nine!&rdquo; she murmured, as she caught through the heavy door a
      familiar voice raised to emphasize some French phrase.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, somebody must teach them. They could not be born with foreign
      idioms and historical dates and mathematical formulae in their little
      heads. She herself deplored the modern tendency that sent a changing drift
      of young teachers through the colleges, to learn at the expense of the
      students a soon relinquished profession. But how ridiculous the position
      of the women who prided themselves on the steadiness and continuity of
      their service! Surely they must find it an empty success at times. They
      must regret.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was passing through the chapel. Two scrubbing-women were straightening
      the chairs, their backs turned to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From all I hear,&rdquo; said one, with a chuckle and a sly glance, &ldquo;we'll be
      afther gettin' our invitations soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' to what?&rdquo; demanded the other quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, they say it's a weddin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, now, hush yer noise, Mary Nolan; 'tis no such thing. I've had enough
      o' husbands. I know when I'm doin' well, an' that's as I am!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis strange that the men sh'd think different, now, but they do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They laughed heartily and long. The German assistant looked at the broad
      backs meditatively. Just now they seemed to her more consistent than any
      other women in the great building.
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked quickly across the greening campus. The close-set brick
      buildings seemed to press up against her; every window stood for some
      crowded, narrow room, filled with books and tea-cups and clothes and
      photographs&mdash;hundreds of them, and all alike. In her own room she
      tried to reason herself out of this intolerable depression, to realize the
      advantages of a quiet life in what was surely the same pleasant, cultured
      atmosphere to which she had so eagerly looked forward three years ago. Her
      room was large, well furnished, perfectly heated; and if the condition of
      her closet would have appeared nothing short of appalling to a
      householder, that condition was owing to the hopeless exigencies of the
      occasion. With the exception of that whited sepulchre, all was neat,
      artistic, eminently habitable. She surveyed it critically: the &ldquo;Mona
      Lisa,&rdquo; the large &ldquo;Melrose Abbey,&rdquo; the Burne-Jones draperies, and the
      &ldquo;Blessed Damozel&rdquo; that spread a placid if monotonous culture through the
      rooms of educated single women. A proper appreciation of polished wood,
      the sanitary and aesthetic values of the open fire, a certain scheme in
      couch-pillows, all linked it to the dozen other rooms that occupied the
      same relative ground-floor corners in a dozen other houses. Some of them
      had more books, some ran to handsome photographs, some afforded fads in
      old furniture; but it was only a question of more or less. It looked
      utterly impersonal to-day; its very atmosphere was artificial, typical, a
      pretended self-sufficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
      How many years more should she live in it&mdash;three, nine, thirteen? The
      tide of girls would ebb and flow with every June and September; eighteen
      to twenty-two would ring their changes through the terms, and she could
      take her choice of the two methods of regarding them: she could insist on
      a perennial interest in the separate personalities, and endure weariness
      for the sake of an uncertain influence; or she could mass them frankly as
      the student body, and confine the connection to marking their class-room
      efforts and serving their meat in the dining-room. The latter was at once
      more honest and more easy; all but the most ambitious or the most
      conscientious came ta it sooner or later.
    </p>
    <p>
      The youngest among the assistants, themselves fresh from college, mingled
      naturally enough with the students; they danced and skated and enjoyed
      their girlish authority. The older women, seasoned to the life, settled
      there indefinitely, identified themselves more or less with the town,
      amused themselves with their little aristocracy of precedence, and wove
      and interwove the complicated, slender strands of college gossip. But a
      woman of barely thirty, too old for friendships with young girls, too
      young to find her placid recreation in the stereotyped round of social
      functions, that seemed so perfectly imitative of the normal and yet so
      curiously unsuccessful at bottom&mdash;what was there for her?
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were fixed on the hill-slope view that made her room so
      desirable. It occurred to her that its changelessness was not necessarily
      so attractive a characteristic as the local poets practised themselves in
      assuring her.
    </p>
    <p>
      A light knock at the door recalled to her the utter lack of privacy that
      put her at the mercy of laundress, sophomore, and expressman. She
      regretted that she had not put up the little sign whose &ldquo;<i>Please do not
      disturb</i>&rdquo; was her only means of defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; she called shortly, and the tall girl in the green dress stood in
      the open door. A strange sense of long acquaintance, a vague feeling of
      familiarity, surprised the older woman. Her expression changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; she said cordially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;am I disturbing you?&rdquo; asked the girl doubtfully. She had a pile
      of books on her arm; her trim jacket and hat, and something in the way she
      held her armful, seemed curiously at variance with her tam-o'-shantered,
      golf-caped friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't find out whether you had an office hour, and I didn't know
      whether I ought to have sent in my name&mdash;it seemed so formal, when it
      is only a moment I need to see you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; said the German assistant pleasantly. &ldquo;What can I do for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been talking with Fräulein Müller about my German, and she says if
      you are willing to give me an outline for advanced work and an examination
      later on, I can go into a higher division in a little while. Languages are
      always easy for me, and I could go on much quicker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, certainly. I have thought more than once that you were wasting your
      time. The class is too large and too slow. I will make you out an outline
      and give it to you after class to-morrow,&rdquo; said the German assistant
      promptly. &ldquo;Meanwhile, won't you stay and make me a little call? I will
      light the fire and make some tea, if that is an inducement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The invitation is inducement enough, I assure you,&rdquo; smiled the girl, &ldquo;but
      I must not stay to-day, I think. If you will let me come again, when I
      have no work to bother you with, I should love to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was something easily decisive in her manner, something very
      different from the other students, who refused such invitations awkwardly,
      eager to be pressed, and when finally assured of a sincere welcome,
      prolonged their calls and talked about themselves into the uncounted
      hours. Evidently she would not stay this time; evidently she would like to
      come again.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the door closed behind her the German assistant dropped her cordial
      smile, and sank back listlessly in her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all, she's only a girl!&rdquo; she murmured. For almost an hour she sat
      looking fixedly at the unlit logs, hardly conscious of the wasted time.
      Much might have gone into that hour. There was tea for her at one of the
      college houses&mdash;the hostess had a &ldquo;day,&rdquo; and went so far as to aspire
      to the exclusive serving of a certain kind of tinned fancy biscuit every
      Friday&mdash;if she wanted to drop in. This hostess invited favored
      students to meet the faculty and townspeople on these occasions, and the
      two latter classes were expected to effect a social fusion with the former&mdash;which
      linked it, to some minds, a little too obviously with professional duties.
    </p>
    <p>
      She might call on the head of her department, who was suffering from some
      slight indisposition, and receive minute advice as to the conduct of her
      classes, mingled with general criticism of various colleagues and their
      methods. She might make a number of calls; but if there is one situation
      in which the futility of these social mockeries becomes most thoroughly
      obvious, it is the situation presented by an attempt to imitate the
      conventional society life in a woman's college. And yet&mdash;she had gone
      over the whole question so often&mdash;what a desert of awkwardness and
      learned provincialism such a college would be without the attempt! How
      often she had cordially agreed to the statement that it was precisely
      because of its insistence upon this connection with the forms and
      relations of normal life that her college was so successfully free from
      the tomboyishness or the priggishness or the gaucherie of some of the
      others! And yet its very success came from begging the question, after
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head impatiently. A strong odor of boiling chocolate crept
      through the transom. Somebody began to practise a monotonous accompaniment
      on the guitar. Over her head a series of startling bumps and jarring falls
      suggested a troupe of baby elephants practising for their first appearance
      in public. The German assistant set her teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before I die,&rdquo; she announced to her image in the glass, &ldquo;I propose to
      inquire flatly of Miss Burgess if she <i>does</i> pile her furniture in a
      heap and slide down it on her toboggan! There is no other logical
      explanation of that horrible disturbance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The face in the glass caught her attention. It looked sallow, with lines
      under the eyes. The hair rolled back a little too severely for the
      prevailing mode, and she recalled her late visitor's effectively adjusted
      side-combs, her soft, dark waves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have time for it, evidently,&rdquo; she mused, &ldquo;and after all it is
      certainly more important than modal auxiliaries!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And for half an hour she twisted and looped and coiled, between the
      chiffonnier and a hand-glass, fairly flushing with pleasure at the result.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she said, looking cheerfully at a pile of written papers, &ldquo;I'll
      take a walk, I think&mdash;a real walk.&rdquo; And till dinner-time she tramped
      some of the old roads of her college days&mdash;more girlish than those
      days had found her, lighter-footed, she thought, than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flush was still in her cheeks as she served her hungry tableful, and
      she could not fail to catch the meaning of their frank stares. Pausing in
      the parlor door to answer a question, she overheard a bit of conversation:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn't she look well with her hair low? Quite stunning, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed. If only she wouldn't dress so old! It makes her look older
      than she is. That red waist she wears in the evening is awfully becoming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I hate her in dark things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The regret that she had not found time to put on the red waist was so
      instant and keen that she laughed at herself when alone in her room. She
      moved vaguely about, aimlessly changing the position of the furniture. How
      absurd! To do one's hair differently, and take a long walk, and feel as if
      an old life were somehow far behind one!
    </p>
    <p>
      Later she found herself before her desk, hunting for her foreign
      letter-paper, and once started, her pen flew. There were long meditative
      lapses, followed by nervous haste, as if to make up the lost time; and
      just before the ten-o'clock bell she slipped out to mail a fat
      brown-stamped envelope. The night-watchman chuckled as he watched the head
      shrouded in the golf-cape hood bend a moment over the little white square.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe it's one o' the maids, maybe it's one o' the teachers, maybe it's
      one o' the girls,&rdquo; he confided to his lantern; &ldquo;they're all alike, come to
      that! An' a good thing, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the morning the German assistant dismissed her last class early and
      took train for Springfield. On the way to the station a deferential clerk
      from the bookshop waylaid her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment, please. Those books you spoke of. Mr. Hartwell's library is
      up at auction and we're sending a man to buy to-day. If you could get the
      whole set for twenty-five dollars&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled and shook her head. &ldquo;I've changed my mind, thank you&mdash;I
      can't afford it. Yes, I suppose it is a bargain, but books are such a
      trouble to carry about, you know. No, I don't think of anything else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What freedom, what a strange baseless exhilaration! Suppose&mdash;suppose
      it was all a mistake, and she should wake back to the old stubborn,
      perfunctory reality! Perhaps it was better, saner&mdash;that quiet
      taken-for-granted existence. Perhaps she regretted&mdash;but even with the
      half-fear at her heart she laughed at that. If wake she must, she loved
      the dream. How she trusted that man! &ldquo;Always I will wait&rdquo;&mdash;and he
      would. But seven years! She threw the thought behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next days passed in a swift, confused flight. She knew they were all
      discussing her, wondering at her changed face, her fresh, becoming
      clothes; they decided that she had had money left her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of my girls saw you shopping in Springfield last Saturday&mdash;they
      say you got some lovely waists,&rdquo; said her fellow-assistant tentatively.
      &ldquo;Was this one? It's very sweet. You ought to wear red a great deal, you
      look so well in it. Did you know Professor Riggs spoke of your hat with
      wild enthusiasm to Mrs. Austin Sunday? He said it was wonderful what a
      difference a stylish hat made. Not that he meant, of course&mdash;Well,
      it's lovely to be able to get what you want. Goodness knows, I wish I
      could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other laughed. &ldquo;Oh, it's perfectly easy if you really want to,&rdquo; she
      said, &ldquo;it all depends on what you want, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the first week she moved in a kind of exaltation. It was partly that
      her glass showed her a different woman: soft-eyed, with cheeks tinted from
      the long, restless walks through the spring that was coming on with every
      warm, greening day. The excitement of the letter hung over her. She
      pictured her announcement, Fräulein Müller's amazed questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'But&mdash;but I do not understand! You are not well?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Perfectly, thank you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'But I am perfectly satisfied: I do not wish to change. You are not sick,
      then?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Only of teaching, Fräulein.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'But the instructorship&mdash;I was going to recommend&mdash;do not be
      alarmed; you shall have it surely!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'You are very kind, but I have taught long enough.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Then you do not find another position? Are you to be&mdash;'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Always here her heart sank. Was she? What real basis had all this sweet,
      disturbing dream? To write so to a man after seven years! It was not
      decent. She grew satiric. How embarrassing for him to read such a letter
      in the bosom of an affectionate, flaxen-haired family! At least, she would
      never know how he really felt, thank Heaven. And what was left for her
      then? To her own mind she had burned her bridges already. She was as far
      from this place in fancy as if the miles stretched veritably between them.
      And yet she knew no other life. She knew no other men. He was the only
      one. In a flash of shame it came over her that a woman with more
      experience would never have written such a letter. Everybody knew that men
      forget, change, easily replace first loves. Nobody but such a cloistered,
      academic spinster as she would have trusted a seven years' promise. This
      was another result of such lives as they led&mdash;such helpless,
      provincial women. Her resentment grew against the place. It had made her a
      fool.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Sunday afternoon, and she had omitted, in deference to the day, the
      short skirt and walking-hat of her weekday stroll. Sunk in accusing shame,
      her cheeks flaming under her wide, dark hat, her quick step more sweeping
      than she knew, her eyes on the ground, she just escaped collision with a
      suddenly looming masculine figure. A hasty apology, a startled glance of
      appeal, a quick breath that parted her lips, and she was past the
      stranger. But not before she had caught in his eyes a look that quickened
      her heart, that soothed her angry humility. The sudden sincere admiration,
      the involuntary tribute to her charm, was new to her, but the instinct of
      countless generations made it as plain and as much her prerogative as if
      she had been the most successful débutante. She was not, then, an object
      of pity, to be treasured for the sake of the old days; other men, too&mdash;the
      impulse outstripped thought, but she caught up with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dreadful!&rdquo; she murmured, with a consciousness of undreamed depths in
      herself. &ldquo;Of course he is the only one&mdash;the only one!&rdquo; and across the
      water she begged his forgiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      But through all her agony of doubt in the days that followed, one shame
      was miraculously removed, one hope sang faintly beneath: she, too, had her
      power! A glance in the street had called her from one army of her sisters
      to the other, and the difference was inestimable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her classes stared at her with naïve admiration. The girls in the house
      begged for her as a chaperon to Amherst entertainments, and sulked when a
      report that the young hosts found her too attractive to enable strangers
      to distinguish readily between her and her charges rendered another
      selection advisable. The fact that her interest in them was fitful,
      sometimes making her merry and intimate, sometimes relegating them to a
      connection purely professional, only left her more interesting to them;
      and boxes of flowers, respectful solicitations to spreads, and tempting
      invitations to long drives through the lengthening afternoons began to
      elect her to an obvious popularity. Once it would have meant much to her;
      she marvelled now at the little shade of jealousy with which her
      colleagues assured her of it. How long must she wait? When would life be
      real again?
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed to herself to move in a dream that heightened and strained
      quicker as it neared an inevitable shock of waking&mdash;to what? Even at
      the best, to what? Even supposing that&mdash;she put it boldly, as if it
      had been another woman&mdash;she should marry the man who had asked her
      seven years ago, what was there in the very obvious future thus assured
      her that could match the hopes her heart held out? How could it be at once
      the golden harbor, the peaceful end of hurried, empty years, and the
      delicious, shifting unrest that made a tumult of her days and nights? Yet
      something told her that it was; something repeated insistently, &ldquo;Always I
      will wait.&rdquo;... He would keep faith, that grave, big man!
    </p>
    <p>
      But every day, as she moved with tightened lips to the table where the
      mail lay spread, coloring at a foreign stamp, paling with the
      disappointment, her hope grew fainter. He dared not write and tell her. It
      was over. Violet shadows darkened her eyes; a feverish flush made her, as
      it grew and faded at the slightest warning, more girlish than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the young life about her seemed only to mock her own late weakened
      impulse. It was not the same. She was playing heavy stakes: they hardly
      realized the game. All but one, they irritated her. This one, since her
      first short call, had come and come again. No explanations, no
      confidences, had passed between them; their sympathy, deep-rooted,
      expressed itself perfectly in the ordinary conventional tone of two
      reserved if congenial natures. The girl did not discuss herself, the woman
      dared not. They talked of books, music, travel; never, as if by tacit
      agreement, of any of the countless possible personalities in a place so
      given to personal discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not have told how she knew that the girl had come to college to
      please a mother whose great regret was to have missed such training, nor
      did she remember when her incurious friend had learned her tense
      determination of flight; she could have sworn that she had never spoken of
      it. Sometimes, so perfectly did they appear to understand each other
      beneath an indifferent conversation, it seemed to her that the words must
      be the merest symbols, and that the girl who always caught her lightest
      shade of meaning knew to exactness her alternate hope and fear, the
      rudderless tossing toward and from her taunting harbor-light.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat by an open window, breathing in the moist air from the fresh,
      upturned earth. The gardeners were working over the sprouting beds; the
      sun came in warm and sweet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three weeks ago it was almost cold at this time,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;In the
      springtime I give up going home, and love the place. But two years more&mdash;two
      years!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really mind it so much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think what I mind the most is that I don't like it more,&rdquo; said the girl
      slowly. &ldquo;Mamma wanted it so. She really loved study. I don't, but if I did&mdash;I
      should love it more than this. This would seem so childish. And if I just
      wanted a good time, why, then this would seem such a lot of trouble. All
      the good things here seem&mdash;seem remedies!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The older woman laughed nervously. Three weeks&mdash;three weeks and no
      word!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be making epigrams, my dear, if you don't take care,&rdquo; she said
      lightly. &ldquo;But you're going to finish just the same? The girls like you,
      your work is good; you ought to stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl flashed a look of surprise at her. It was her only hint of
      sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You advise me to?&rdquo; she asked quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it would be a pity to disappoint your mother,&rdquo; with a light hand
      on her shoulder. &ldquo;You are so young&mdash;four years is very, little. Of
      course you could do the work in half the time, but you admit that you are
      not an ardent student. If nobody came here but the girls that really
      needed to, we shouldn't have the reputation that we have. The girls to
      whom this place means the last word in learning and the last grace of
      social life are estimable young women, but not so pleasant to meet as
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Three weeks&mdash;but he had waited seven years!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very childish,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;Of course I will stay. And some of
      it I like very much. It's only that mamma doesn't understand. She
      overestimates it so. Somehow, the more complete it is, the more like
      everything else, the more you have to find fault with on all sides. I'd
      rather have come when mamma was a girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. I have thought that, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ah, fool, give up your senseless hope! You had your chance&mdash;you lost
      it. Fate cannot stop and wait while you grow wise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When that shadow covers the hill, I will give it up forever. Then I will
      write to Henry's wife and ask her to let me come and help take care of the
      children. She will like it, and I can get tutoring if I want it. I will
      make the children love me, and there will be a place where I shall be
      wanted and can help,&rdquo; she thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shadow slipped lower. The fresh turf steeped in the last rays, the
      birds sang, the warming earth seemed to have touched the very core of
      spring. Her hopes had answered the eager years, but her miracle was too
      wonderful to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      A light knock at the door, and a maid came toward her, tray in hand. She
      lifted the card carelessly&mdash;her heart dropped a moment and beat in
      hard, slow throbs. Her eyes filled with tears; her cheeks were hot and
      brilliant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will be there in a moment.&rdquo; How deep her voice sounded!
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl slipped by her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was going anyway,&rdquo; she said softly. &ldquo;Good-by! Don't touch your hair&mdash;it's
      just right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not wait for an answer, but went out. As she passed by the little
      reception-room a tall, eager man made toward her with outstretched hands.
      Her voice trembled as she laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no&mdash;I'm not the one,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;but she&mdash;she's
      coming!&rdquo;
